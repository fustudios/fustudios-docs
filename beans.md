Collect beans while you play OpenSeason in exchange for $FU Money at the end of the Epoch (1 week).

## Beans worth dying for

Each Epoch a continuous amount of beans will be made available to be collected by playing OpenSeason. At the end of each Epoch players can exchange their earned beans for $FU money.

Beans are then reset to zero at the beginning of the next epoch allowing all players to start equally.

### Earn extra beans with Game Pass Pro

If you are a Game Pass Pro holder, you earn 100% of the beans you collect. If you are a Game Pass holder—you used an access code to play the game—20% of the beans you collect are actually earned by the Game Pass Pro associated with your Game Pass.

The only way to earn 100% of the beans you collect is by holding a Game Pass Pro.

### Beans collected vs beans earned.

You can collect beans by either playing Ranked or non Ranked matches. The more beans you earn the greater your share of the final $FU distribution!

The amount of beans you earn is actually different from the amount you collect. Game Pass holders for example, only earn 80% of the beans they collect. The remaining 20% goes to the Game Pass Pro NFT that generated the access code for that Game Pass.

The way the game is played also influences the amount of beans you earn. If you are a bean simp—only plays the game to collect beans and leaves— you will be penalized.
Currently the formula for earning beans per match is `Kills + Deaths / BeansCollected`.
If that value is below 1 the player will suffer a penalty and earn only the fraction of the beans they collected.

> Example:
>
> Alice finished the match with 20 kills, 10 deaths and 20 beans.
> `20 + 10 / 20 = 1.5`
>
> Because she is above the 1 point cut she keeps all of her beans.
>
> Bob finished the match with 1 kill, 1 death and 40 beans.
> ` 1 + 1 / 40 = 0.05`
>
> Because Bob is below 1 a penalty will be applied.
>
> The final amount of earned beans will be:
> `40 * 0.05 = 2`

In short. The less interaction (Death or Kills) during the match and the more beans you collect the less beans you get to keep.

### Bean Multipliers and $FU allocation

**20%** of $FU is currently allocated to non ranked players. These are players that either have not played a ranked match or played and sucked so badly that they did not get any XP.

**70%** goes to Ranked Players with XP greater than 0. A multiplier based on each player’s XP amount is added to all the beans they have earned (through ranked matches, non ranked and Game Passes associated with their Game Pass Pro)

Their final share of Beans will translate to the final share of $FU they will earn for the Epoch.

Beans reset to zero on each Epoch, giving new players the same chance of earning $FU as the veteran players.

**10%** is reserved to the communities behind OpenSeason’s characters.

### $FU Distribution

At the end of each Epoch, the final bean earned amount is calculated and $FU is distributed to all wallets.

**Important! If by the end of the Epoch, you don’t have a wallet verified on OpenSeason.games, you will not earn any $FU for that Epoch and that $FU will be distributed to those who have their wallets verified.**
