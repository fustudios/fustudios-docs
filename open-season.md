![Open Season](.gitbook/assets/open-season.png)

Play as Milady, Remilio or Bored Ape in this battle royale third-person shooter which takes place in the Island of JPEG. Explore the Apes’ Swamp or Milady Village in search of weapons and loot.

Currently in its alpha version, this is the first game produced by FU Studios. It is the blueprint for future productions and it showcases how an idea can be funded, built, monetized and distributed using the incentive structures developed by FU Studios.

## Gameplay

### Battle Royale

Players are dropped into a vast, dynamic battleground where they compete against each other for weapons and loot, until only one remains standing.

Whether you're a lone wolf or part of a team, the adrenaline-fueled action of Battle Royale promises an exhilirating gaming experience.

### Death Match

Situated in a much smaller area, Death Match is action packed and fast paced. Players start with a pistol and are continuously respawned after they die. The match lasts 10 minutes and the one with the most kills wins.

Death Matches come in **two flavors**:

#### Normal

Players can collect beans while they target practice on bots. Participants can join a match at any moment which increases the chances of playing with other real humans.

#### Ranked Matches

These are special matches announced in advance. A ranked match does not have bots and only starts after 10 players join the game. Players of ranked matches earn points and are ranked against other players. The leaderboard is persistent and 70% of the $FU Rewards are allocated to ranked players.

## Cost and Access

Fully released versions of Open Season are **free to play**. [Access to the game](access.md) can be achieved by holding a **Game Pass** or a **Game Pass Pro**.

# Partnerships

## How to add new in-game Avatars and Biomes

We offer NFT projects a unique partnership opportunity that strengthens brand recognition and rewards holders long term. If you'd like your NFT's to be in-game avatars, get in touch with us to discuss how to have your entire collection whitelisted.

Once whitelisted each NFT holder gains the ability to [upgrade their NFT](https://openseason.games/collections). Many single upgrades can unlock bigger upgrades adding more utility to the collection as a whole.

Once your community upgrade fees reach 5 $ETH in total, we'll make an in-game avatar. Once they reach 25 $ETH, we'll make an in-game Biome based on lore and themes of your project.

If you upgrades fall short of the 2 goals and you want to close the gap manually, we'll allow it.

If you'd like to purchase any or all of the upgrades on behalf of your holders and distribute the ability to play OpenSeason to your community, we welcome that too!

|          | Upgraded NFT Per Unit | Avatar | Biome   |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Upgrades | 1                     | 100    | 500     |
| Sum      | 0.05 $ETH             | 5 $ETH | 25 $ETH |

## Common Issues Connecting to the Game

If you are having issues connecting to the game, even though you have a connected NFT with a Game Pass, make sure to try the below methods to fix the problem

### Clear Game Cache

To clear the cache and reset the connected account for a specific game in the Epic Games Launcher, you'll need to delete the saved data and cache files related to that game. Here’s how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Close the Game and Epic Games Launcher

Make sure the game and the Epic Games Launcher are completely closed before you proceed.

#### 2. Locate the Game's Save and Cache Files

The location of these files may vary depending on the game. Here are some common locations:

- **Local App Data Folder:**

  - Press `Windows Key + R` to open the Run dialog box.
  - Type `%localappdata%` and press Enter.
  - Look for a folder with the name of the game or the game developer. For example, if the game is "OpenSeason," look for a folder named "OpenSeason" or similar.

- **Documents Folder:**
  - Some games store their save files in the Documents folder.
  - Navigate to `C:\Users\[Your Username]\Documents` and look for a folder with the game's name.

#### 3. Delete the Cache and Configuration Files

Once you've located the game's folder, you need to delete or rename specific files or folders to reset the connected account.

- **Example for OpenSeason:**
  - Navigate to `%localappdata%\OpenSeason\Saved`.
  - Delete the `Config` and `Logs` folders.

Look for similar folders such as `Config`, `Saved`, or `Logs`. Deleting these will reset the game's settings, including account data.

#### 4. Clear Epic Games Launcher Web Cache

This step ensures that any cached account information in the launcher is also cleared.

1. Open the Run dialog box by pressing `Windows Key + R`.
2. Type `%localappdata%` and press Enter.
3. Navigate to `EpicGamesLauncher\Saved`.
4. Delete the `webcache` folder.

#### 5. Restart Your Computer

After deleting the relevant files, restart your computer to ensure all changes take effect.

#### 6. Reopen the Epic Games Launcher and the Game

Open the Epic Games Launcher and launch the game. You should be prompted to log in or reconnect your account since the cache and saved account data have been cleared.

### Additional Tips

- **Backup Important Data:**
  Before deleting any files, consider backing up important data such as saved games or custom configurations.

By following these steps, you should be able to clear the cache and reset the connected account for a specific game in the Epic Games Launcher.
