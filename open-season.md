Play as Milady, Remilio or Bored Ape in this battle royale third-person shooter which takes place in the Island of JPEG. Explore the Apesâ€™ Swamp or Milady Village in search of weapons and loot.

Currently in its alpha version, this is the first game produced by FU Studios. It is the blueprint for future productions and it showcases how an idea can be funded, built, monetized and distributed using the incentive structures developed by FU Studios.

### Battle Royale Gameplay

Players are dropped into a vast, dynamic battleground where they compete against each other for weapons and loot, until only one remains standing.

Whether you're a lone wolf or part of a team, the adrenaline-fueled action of Battle Royale promises an exhilirating gaming experience.

### How to add new in-game Avatars and Biomes

We offer NFT projects a unique partnership opportunity that strengthens brand recognition and rewards holders long term. If you'd like your NFT's to be in-game avatars, get in touch with us to discuss how to have your entire collection whitelisted.

Once whitelisted, you'll have a progress dashboard to see how many people in your community have purchased Upgraded NFT's. These are the same upgrades that allow users to play OpenSeason. Once your community upgrade fees reach 5 $ETH in total, we'll make an in-game avatar. Once they reach 25 $ETH, we'll make an in-game Biome based on lore and themes of your project.

If you upgrades fall short of the 2 goals and you want to close the gap manually, we'll allow it.

If you'd like to purchase any or all of the upgrades on behalf of your holders and distribute the ability to play OpenSeason to your community, we welcome that too!

|          | Upgraded NFT Per Unit | Avatar | Biome   |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Upgrades | 1                     | 100    | 500     |
| Sum      | 0.05 $ETH             | 5 $ETH | 25 $ETH |
