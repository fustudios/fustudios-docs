Play as Milady, Remilio or Bored Ape in this battle royale third-person shooter which takes place in the Island of JPEG. Explore the Apes’ Swamp or Milady Village in search of weapons and loot.

With three game modes to choose from, you can either chill shooting npc’s, kill your friends for points or enter into wager matches where the ultimate prize goes to the last man standing.

Currently in its alpha version, this is the first game produced by FU Studios. It is the blueprint for future productions and it showcases how an idea can be funded, built, monetized and distributed using the incentive structures developed by FU Studios.

After the first version of the game is out, the team plans to continuously expand the map, characters and gamemodes.

## Game Modes

### Quick

The game defaults to npc mode so players don’t have to wait in the lobby for others to join the server. The minimum amount of Game Points is allocated to this game mode.

### Normal

Players earn a percentage of game points when they kill an opponent and they lose a portion of points they have accumulated during the current match when they are killed.

### Wager

Users must wager a fixed amount to participate. Under all categories a 15% tax is collected. Last player standing keeps all the tokens minus taxes.
Wagering can be done in either $FUM or $ETH. In $FUM mode the taxes are burned while in $ETH mode it is sent to the treasury. Values in $FUM are calculated at a 100M Market Cap valuation and can be subject to change depending on market conditions.

## Cost and Access

[Membership](https://blur.io/collection/fustudiomembership) holders are the only ones able to play the early access (alpha / beta / pre-releases) version of the game.

Fully released versions of Open Season are **free to play**. Access to the game can be achieved by either holding a Membership or a **Game Pass**.

### Game Passes

The only way to mint a Game Pass is if you have an **Access Code**. Membership holders can create an unlimited amount of Access Codes on the [Open Season website](https://openseason.games/login). **Any Game Pass that is minted using an Access Code is bound to the Membership NFT that has created that Access Code.**

Access Codes are meant to be distributed through the web leveraging a membership holder’s social channels. If a user sells a Membership NFT, they are also selling the Access Code graph and all the Game Pass associations to that NFT. This means that the more Game Passes associated with an NFT, the more they should be worth, since a percentage of game earnings from the Game Passes are passed to the NFT associated with it.

In order to mint a Game Pass a user must also have an Epic account. Because Game Passes are associated with an Epic account a user does not need to hold a web3 wallet or even know about crypto in order to play Open Season.

To learn how you can get a Membership, distribute Access Codes or mint Game Passes check out our [explainer](#instructions).
