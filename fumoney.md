# FU Money ($FUM)

FU Money is what connects all FU Studios productions and supports the ecosystem. It has two main functions, <a href="#utility">**utility**</a> and <a href="#value-accrual">**value accrual**</a>. Inspired by EIP 1559 the utility function requires users to burn $FUM, this cements it as the base money for FU Studios.

## [Utility](#utility)

$FUM not only gives access to exclusive features to users but it can also be converted to a share of the revenue generated by all FU Studios productions.

### $FUM Burn Requirements

The following are examples of actions that will require $FUM burning. This is by no means an exhaustive list and we plan to continuously add utility to the token.

- Acquisition of Rare/Extremely Rare items and weapons.
- Access to locked areas.
  - Extra Game Points.
- Special character upgrades.
  - New Animations.
  - Increase Character Luck.
- Mint a Membership NFT.
  - Gives the holder the right to distribute game passes.
- Game Wagering.
- Initial Liquidity Provision Fees.
- Share of the treasury paid in staked ETH.

## [Value Accrual](#value-accrual)

All revenue generated by FU Studios productions with the exception of Membership sales—which is used for development purposes—is used to buy staked ETH and deposited into the treasury.

The staked ETH can be claimed by burning a relative share of $FUM. As users claim staked ETH the remaining $FUM holder’s share of the treasury increases.
