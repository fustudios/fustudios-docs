There are 2 ways to play OpenSeason: **Game Pass Pro** and **Game Pass**.

# Game Pass Pro

The Game Pass Pro can be claimed on the OpenSeason website by anyone holding an [FU Studios NFT](#fu-studios-nft) or a [Partner NFT Collection](#partner-nft-collection)

Each Game Pass Pro is associated with an NFT, therefore selling the NFT is equivalent to selling the Game Pass Pro.

## FU Studios NFT

**How to acquire:** Can be purchased on the [Blur market](<(https://blur.io/collection/fustudiomembership)>).

**Perks:**

- Generate Access Codes which allow users to claim free Game Passes.
- Earn extra rewards from Game Passes claimed from Access Codes.
- Start earning $FU rewards earlier than Game Pass holders.
- $FU Aidrop. ([Concluded](<(https://github.com/fustudios/membership-drop/blob/main/data/FU.csv)>))
- Golden tag names in-game.
- Early access to all FU Studios productions.

## Partner NFT Collection

**How to acquire:** Owners of whitelisted [NFT collections](https://openseason.games/collections) (such as Based Ghouls, Sproto Gremlins, etc) can upgrade their NFTs to gain early access to the game, rewards and the ability to mint Access Codes.

**Perks:**

- Early Access to OpenSeason
- Generate Access Codes which allow users to claim free Game Passes.
- Earn extra rewards from Game Passes claimed from Access Codes.
- Start earning $FU rewards earlier than Game Pass holders.

# Game Pass

**How to acquire:** After Beta, anyone will be able to claim a Game Pass using an Access Code. (Soon™)

**Perks:**

- Allows holders to play corresponding FU Studios game for free.
- Will be able to earn $FU after official production launch.

## Access Codes

The only way to mint a Game Pass is if you have an **Access Code**. Game Pass Pro holders can create an unlimited amount of Access Codes on the [Open Season website](https://openseason.games/login). **Any Game Pass that is minted using an Access Code is bound to the NFT (Game Pass Pro) that has created that Access Code.**

Access Codes are meant to be distributed leveraging a Game Pass Pro holder’s social network. If a user sells a FU Studio NFT, they are also selling all the Game Pass associations to that NFT. This means that the more Game Passes associated with an NFT, the more they are potentially worth, since a percentage of game earnings from the Game Passes are passed to the NFT associated with it.

In order to mint a Game Pass a user must also have an Epic account. Because Game Passes are associated with an Epic account a user does not need to hold a web3 wallet or even know about crypto in order to play OpenSeason.
